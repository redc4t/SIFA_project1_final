##Rudimentary character sheet generator

For this project I am planning to create a character sheet generator that uses a backend database to populate values on a front end basic character sheet page.

the CRUD functionality will come from the use of being able to save generated characters, update racial trits/values and class values, remove racial values and class values and even delete values or tables themselves from the database with either simple command or button press from the app itself.

I will be achieving this by using python and the flask microframework to create an application using the languages Python and HTML. supplementing these will be the use of Jenkins, AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Gunicorn.
